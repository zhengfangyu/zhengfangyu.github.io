I am an assistant researcher in the Institute of Information Engineering, Chinese Acadamy of Sciences (IIE-CAS). I am also the Chief Engineer of Testing Lab in DCS center, CAS.

I received Bachelor’s Degree from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) and received Ph.D. from the University of Chinese Acadamy of Sciences (UCAS).

My research interests lie in the general area of cryptography and security, particularly in applied cryptography, cryptographic engineering, cryptographic testing, and evaluation, as well as high-performance cryptographic computing.

My job focuses on applying cryptography in reality. Parts of my achievements include:
* High-performance cryptographic servers (20Mops+ of digital signature and FIPS 140 certificated). 
* Secure and fast software cryptographic implementations (numberous publications and implementations).
* Cryptography evaluation methods (2 fundamental standards, i.e., GB/T 37092 and GB/T 39786).
